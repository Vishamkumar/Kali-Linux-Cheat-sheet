- **Intercept Responses:** Proxy > Intercept > Intercept Server Responses
- **Forward Intercepted Requests:** Press the Forward button in the Proxy tab
- **Drop Intercepted Requests:** Press the Drop button in the Proxy tab

### Scanner

Burp Suite scans for vulnerabilities in web applications.

- **Start a New Scan:** Scanner > New Scan
- **Choose Scan Type:** Select from Active, Passive, or Spider scanning
- **Configure Scan Settings:** Set the scope, URLs to exclude, and scan issues to report

### Repeater

Burp Suite allows you to manually send requests and view responses.

- **Send a Request:** Select a request in the Proxy tab and click Send to Repeater
- **Modify a Request:** Edit the request in the Repeater tab

### Intruder

Burp Suite allows you to automate requests with payloads and perform brute-force attacks.

- **Start an Intruder Attack:** Intruder > Start Attack
- **Choose Attack Type:** Select from Sniper, Battering Ram, Pitchfork, or Cluster Bomb attacks
- **Configure Payload:** Add or remove payloads to use in the attack

### Decoder

Burp Suite allows you to decode or encode data in various formats.
