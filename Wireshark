# Wireshark Cheatsheet

Wireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer that allows you to see what's happening on your network at a microscopic level. Here are some of the key features and commands that you need to know when working with Wireshark.

## Key Features

- **Capture and display packets**: Wireshark can capture and display packets from a wide range of network protocols, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and many others.
- **Powerful filtering**: Wireshark provides a powerful filtering system that allows you to focus on the packets that matter most to you.
- **Live capture and offline analysis**: Wireshark can capture packets in real-time, as well as analyze packets that have been captured and saved to a file.
- **Customizable views**: Wireshark allows you to customize the way packets are displayed, including the color scheme, layout, and more.

## Basic Commands

Here are some of the basic commands that you need to know when working with Wireshark:

| Command                 | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wireshark`             | Start Wireshark                                                                   |
| `wireshark -k`          | Start Wireshark and immediately start capturing packets                           |
| `wireshark -r <file>`   | Open a capture file for analysis                                                  |
| `wireshark -f <filter>` | Start Wireshark and immediately start capturing packets with the specified filter |

## Advanced Commands

Here are some of the advanced commands that you can use when working with Wireshark:

| Command                  | Description                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `tshark -i <interface>`  | Capture packets on the specified interface |
| `tshark -D`              | List available capture interfaces          |
| `tshark -r <file>`       | Analyze a capture file                     |
| `tshark -V`              | Display packet details in verbose mode     |
| `tshark -R <filter>`     | Apply a filter to the packets              |
| `tshark -z <statistics>` | Generate statistics on captured packets    |

This file provides a quick reference for using Wireshark in networking and cybersecurity labs. It focuses on commonly used capture options, display filters, shortcuts, and analysis features useful for students and beginners.

## Capture Basics
- Start capture: Ctrl + E
- Stop capture: Ctrl + E
- Restart capture: Ctrl + R
- Save capture file: Ctrl + S
- Select interface: Wi-Fi or Ethernet based on active connection

## Common Display Filters
- HTTP traffic:
  http
- HTTPS traffic:
  tls
- TCP traffic:
  tcp
- UDP traffic:
  udp
- ICMP (ping):
  icmp
- DNS traffic:
  dns
- Specific IP address:
  ip.addr == 192.168.1.1
- Source IP:
  ip.src == 192.168.1.1
- Destination IP:
  ip.dst == 192.168.1.1
- Specific port:
  tcp.port == 80

## Capture Filters (Before Capture)
- Capture HTTP traffic:
  port 80
- Capture HTTPS traffic:
  port 443
- Capture traffic from specific host:
  host 192.168.1.1

## Packet Analysis
- Follow TCP Stream:
  Right-click packet → Follow → TCP Stream
- View protocol layers:
  Frame → Ethernet → IP → TCP/UDP → Application
- Hex view:
  Shows raw packet data

## Statistics and Analysis
- Protocol hierarchy:
  Statistics → Protocol Hierarchy
- Conversations:
  Statistics → Conversations
- Endpoints:
  Statistics → Endpoints
- Traffic graphs:
  Statistics → IO Graphs

## Useful Shortcuts
- Find packet: Ctrl + F
